## About me
Hello, I'm Anna, welcome to my little internet home! I've been trying to live a more planet friendly lifestyle for a few years now, and this my place to reflect on that, and document what I'm learning. You can also head to my instagram [@thelocalwildflower](https://www.instagram.com/thelocalwildflower/) to see pretty pictures and less rambly thoughts! In a nutshell, I love animals, I care a lot about environmental and social justice, I like to travel, to cook and to eat (vegetarian and mainly plant-based food), and to make things. I have always cared about protecting the environment, and while my environmental education during school was practically non-existent, I made up for it when I went to university and eventually realised I was not heading in quite the right direction, and that actually dedicating myself in some way to environmental and social justice was probably something I definitely wanted to do.

After uni I spent a few months fulfilling my travel dreams, while also trying to travel sustainably and create some positive impact in the places I visited. Travelling opened my eyes even further to the social and environmental injustice in the world; it helped me see the root causes more clearly, and to face up to the huge reality of the problem, but also to see that there are so many ideas and solutions, and people fighting to put it right.  In the end, all of my wandering has led me back home to get a Masters in Sustainability and Environmental Studies, so that I can continue to learn as much as possible, share what I know, and fight for our planet and for the health and happiness of all the plants, animals and people who live on it.
