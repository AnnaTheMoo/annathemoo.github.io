## About me
Hello, I’m Anna!
Recently graduated with a degree I’m not sure what to do with, I’ve decided now is the perfect time to take my life savings - always put away in a “travel fund” because I always wanted to travel the world - and finally go travelling.
I have been trying for the past few years to live more sustainably, and knowing how environmentally damaging travel can be, I am challenging myself to continue to live this way as I begin to wander the globe.
I want to be ethical in the activities I engage in, minimise the trail of pollution that I leave behind me, and avoid having a negative impact on the communities I come into contact with...and this little spot is where I will document my experiences.
